description: Handle the most common basic CSGClaw CLI administration tasks. Use when the Manager needs to create a room, list bots, create a bot, inspect room members, add a bot into a room, or perform similar direct `csgclaw-cli` operations for routine room, bot, and membership management.

# CSGClaw CLI Basics

Execute common `csgclaw-cli` operations directly and keep the flow simple.
Prefer this skill whenever the user is asking for basic room, bot, or member management.

## Scope

This skill covers direct CLI actions such as:

- create a room
- list rooms
- list all bots
- create a bot
- list room members
- add a bot as a room member
- send a message, including a message with a mention
- check command help for the current CLI surface before assuming flags

Do not use this skill when the task requires any of the following:

- break a request into multiple worker-owned tasks
- orchestrate a multi-worker workflow
- manage cross-worker sequencing or tracking state

## Workflow

1. Identify the exact room, bot, or member operation the user needs.
2. If room context matters, inspect it first with `room list` or `member list`, especially to see whether the room is direct.
3. Run `csgclaw-cli <entity> -h` or `csgclaw-cli <entity> <verb> -h` if the current command surface is not already clear.
4. Execute the smallest direct CLI command that completes the request.
5. Show the user the key result such as the room ID, bot ID, member list summary, or sent message result.

## Common Commands

Create a room:

```bash
csgclaw-cli room create --title test-room --creator-id ou_xxx --channel <current_channel>
```

List rooms and check whether a room is direct:

```bash
csgclaw-cli room list --channel <current_channel>
```

List bots:

```bash
csgclaw-cli bot list --channel <current_channel>
```

Create a bot. Always include `--description`:

```bash
csgclaw-cli bot create --id u-alex --name alex --description "frontend worker for settings tasks" --role worker --channel <current_channel>
```

List members in a room:

```bash
csgclaw-cli member list --room-id oc_xxx --channel <current_channel>
```

Add a bot into a non-direct room:

```bash
csgclaw-cli member create --room-id oc_xxx --user-id u-alex --inviter-id u-manager --channel <current_channel>
```

If the current room is direct, do not try to add the bot directly. Create a new room that includes the current DM participants plus the new bot:

```bash
csgclaw-cli room create \
  --title "manager-dev-alex" \
  --creator-id u-manager \
  --member-ids u-manager,u-dev,u-alex \
  --channel <current_channel>
```

Send a message with a mention:

```bash
csgclaw-cli message create --room-id oc_xxx --sender-id u-manager --content "Please take a look." --mention-id u-alex --channel <current_channel>
```

## Operating Rules

- Prefer direct `csgclaw-cli` commands over ad hoc HTTP calls.
- Use `bot list` before creating a new bot if the user may be referring to an existing one.
- When creating a bot, always pass a meaningful `--description` so later matching and reuse remain clear.
- Verify room membership with `member list` after adding a member when room presence matters.
- A direct room cannot accept an added bot as a new member. If the current room is direct, create a new room with `--member-ids` containing the existing DM users and the new bot.
- Keep the response focused on the concrete CLI result instead of introducing external planning artifacts.
- Hand off to `manager-worker-dispatch` only if the user explicitly needs manager orchestration or multi-worker sequencing.
